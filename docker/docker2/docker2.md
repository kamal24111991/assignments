	Assignment 2 Docker

	Assignment 1
1. Run a docker container from "hello-world" image.
```
#docker run hello-world
```
2. Pull "alpine" image from docker registry and see if image is available in your local image list.
```
#docker pull alpine
#docker images
Output:-
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world         latest              e38bc07ac18e        6 weeks ago         1.85kB
alpine              latest              3fd9065eaf02        4 months ago        4.15MB
```
3. Pull some specific version of docker "alpine" image from docker registry.
```
#docker pull alpine:3.3
```
4. Run a docker container from local image "alpine" and run an inline command "ls -l" while running container.
```
# docker run -it alpine ls -l

5. Try to take login to container created using "alpine" image.
```
#docker run -it alpine /bin/ash
```
6. Detach yourself from the container without making it exit/container kill.
```
#ctrl + p +q
```
7. Check running containers and see if you can find out the stopped containers.
```
#docker ps
Output:-
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
b78ad027cede        alpine              "/bin/sh"           5 seconds ago       Up 4 seconds                            quirky_dubinsky
```
8. Stop running container.
```
#docker stop b78ad027cede
#docker ps (you will see no container is running)
```

9. Start container that was stopped earlier.

```
#docker start b78ad027cede
#docker ps (you will see container is running with same container id)
```
10. Try to remove "alpine" image from your local system.
```
#docker rmi alpine
Oupout:-
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository 	reference "alpine" (must force) - container b78ad027cede is using its 	referenced image 3fd9065eaf02
```

Assignment 2

1. Again pull "alpine" image from docker registry.
```
#docker pull alpine
```
2. Take interactive login to bash while running docker container from "alpine" image.
```
#docker run -it -name alpine alpine ash
```
3. Run command inside container: echo "hello world" > hello.txt ls
```
# echo “hello world” > hello.txt
# ls
Output: 
bin        hello.txt  media      root       srv        usr
dev        home       mnt        run        sys        var
etc        lib        proc       sbin       tmp
```
4. Take exit from same container without killing the container.
```
#ctrl + p + q
```
5. Run another container using below command and check if you can find hello.txt within this container. You should find container isolations from step 3-5. docker container run alpine ls

```
# docker run -it  alpine ash
# ls
Output:
bin    etc    lib    mnt    root   sbin   sys    usr
dev    home   media  proc   run    srv    tmp    var
(There is no hello.txt present in this conatiner)
```

6. Stop a container using Container ID.
```
#sudo docker stop e08e6d8fd030
```
7. Start same container using ID and exec a command "echo 'hello world!'" in docker container without instantiating a new container.
```
#sudo docker start e08e6d8fd030
#sudo docker exec -it e08e6d8fd030 echo "hello world"
```
8. Inspect already downloaded "alpine" docker image using docker inspect command.
```
#sudo docker inpect alpine
```
9. Tag your local "alpine" image with name "myimage" along with version 1.0
```
#sudo docker tag alpine myimage:version1.0
```
